//Create a Person constructor that accepts name and age as parameters and sets those properties accordingly in the Constructor.

  //code here
function Person(name, age){
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sayName = {
    alert(sayName)
  }
}

//Now create three instances of Person with data you make up

  //code here
var bert = new Person('bert', 35);
var ernie = new Person('ernie', 35);

//Now add a sayName method on your Person class that will alert the name of whatever Person instance called it.

  //code here
